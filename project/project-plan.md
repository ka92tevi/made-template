## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Is there a statistically significant correlation between GDP per capita and the annual unemployment rate across European countries from 2017 to 2021?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Correlating the GDP per capita and the annual unemployment rate per thousand for European countries between 2017-2021 can provide insights into the economic dynamics of these countries during the specified time period. The correlation analysis aims to understand the potential relationship between the economic prosperity, as measured by GDP per capita, and the labor market conditions, as reflected in the annual unemployment rate.

A positive correlation might suggest that as GDP per capita increases,indicating economic growth, the unemployment rate tends to decrease.This could imply that a stronger economy is generally associated with lower unemployment rates. Conversely, a negative correlation might suggest that economic struggles are associated with higher unemployment rates.
